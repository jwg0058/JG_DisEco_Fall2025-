This is the Epidemiological Triad representing the connection between host, pathogen environment and environment and how they interact with each other.

1)  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. (5 points)

-   59 Deer

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios: (5 points)\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

-   299

    b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

-   149

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\

-   \<1% at 95%.
