1)  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. (5 points)

-   59 Deer

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios: (5 points)\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

-   299

    b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

-   149

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\

-   \<1% at 95%.

Janâ€™s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows: RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25. Show your work.

Worksheet 3: Measures of disease frequency: Prevalence and Incidence

a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence. (9 points)

**6/12/25 - 6/53 (0.113) Elk cases per day**

**6/14/25 - 3/45 (0.067) Elk cases per day**

**6/15/25 - 0/42 (0) Elk cases per day**

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence. (5 points)

**6/13/25 - 10/56 (0.179) Cases per Elk population**

**6/16/25 - 8/56 (0.143) Cases per Elk population**

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

**6/10/25**

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest? (3 points)

**6/16/25**
