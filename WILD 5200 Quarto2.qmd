**Worksheet 3**

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows: RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

[**Tick Lab**]{.underline}

When identifying tick species, you first begin with the life stage. This is evident by the presence or absence of a genital pore and the number of legs, with larvae having 6 and adults and nymphs having 8. The next step is to identify sex with males having conscutum and females having alloscutum. The third step is to identify the genus based on the location of the anal groove, anterior or posterior. The last step in tick identification is to identify species using the SAM method: Scutum pattern, Anal groove location, and whether the mouthparts are long or short. It is important to be able to identify ticks because of the pathogens each one carries. Each tick species carries diseases that can become a threat to public health if not properly monitored.

**Exam 1 Rework**

7.  Mass die-off of saiga antelopes was caused by a bacterium called *Pasteurella multocida*, which typically lives in the nasal cavities of the antelopes; however, in 2015, the environmental conditions led to increased humidity and temperatures, which caused the bacteria to become pathogenic and deadly to the antelopes. Because the antelopes gather in large populations during the birthing season, the close contact greatly increased the host availability, allowing the pathogen to run rampant within the population, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals. Some strategies to prevent these MMEs in the future include monitoring environmental conditions, researching potential vaccines, and improving disease surveillance. Broader conservation methods include reducing other stressors on the population, such as poaching and habitat loss, so that saiga numbers can recover naturally.

9.  R₀ is the basic reproduction number noted by the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population.

    Situation 1 - one flamingo infects 1 flamingo for a total of 1

    Situation 2 - one flamingo infects 3 flamingos for a total of 3

    Situation 3 - one flamingo infects 2 flamingos for a total of 2

    Situation 4 - One infected flamingo infects 0 other flamingos for a total of 0

The average of the R₀ in the 4 situations is 1+3+2+0/4 = 1.5

In the real world, utility R₀ can be used to describe how infectious a particular disease is, with R₀\> 1 indicating the infection will likely spread through the population and could become a pandemic, R₀=1 representing that the disease is in a steady state and remains endemic, and R₀\<1 representing that the infection will die out. R₀ can also be used in disease models and can be calculated by the rate of infection/ the rate of recovery, or β​/γ.

**Worksheet 4 10/23/25**

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in healthcare–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Center for Disease Prevention and Control)

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

-   The disease is maintained within the Camel population

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

-   True Camels are the main animal reservoir

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

-   True Humans are the dead-end host

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

-   No, as stated above, the case fatality rate is 35%

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

-   The epi curve represents a propagated outbreak due to the many peaks noted on the graph

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Worksheet 5**

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024 The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1\. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

-   This incident would be considered a spillover event based on the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen. This is because humans contracted the virus from a reservoir animal species to humans and it consisted of non-sustained human-to-human transmission.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings? 5 points

-   One way to reduce transmission within the community is to educate the public on the situation and how to avoid bat exposure, mentioning staying away from caves inhabited by bats without proper PPE. Those who experience symptoms should self-isolate to limit the spread and report their symptoms to the local health authorities for outbreak surveillance. Fention and Penfersen recommend 3 techniques in controlling infection

    -   Control the target population (Humans)

    -   Prevent transmission between the target and reservoir

    -   Control the Reservoir (Bats)

-   To reduce the spread of infection in hospital settings, those working directly with patients should have proper PPE and practice correct hand washing techniques. Patients with similar symptoms should be grouped together to avoid contact with uninfected patients. Patients' rooms who were infectious should receive proper cleaning with disinfectants.

**Worksheet 6**

Pond 1

• Prevalence

N- 20, Infected - 6

Prevalence (30%) Lower - 14%, upper - 52.5% at 95% CI

• Fisher’s exact test p-value - 0.1987

Pond 2

• Prevalence (6.7%) Lower - 0.3%, upper - 30.2% at 95% CI

N- 15, Infected -1

• Fisher’s exact test p-value - 0.1987

• Interpretation

Prevalence was found to be higher in pond 1 than in pond 2, but it cannot be determined to be statistically significant due to the Fisher’s exact test p-value being greater than 0.05, and it is assumed that the observed difference in prevalence is most likely due to random chance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Worksheet 7**

[Nipah Virus]{.underline}

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

-   In Malaysia, Bats are infecting food that pigs are consuming; in this case, pigs are the bridge host that are able to pass on the disease to humans. This focuses the preventive measures towards the bridge species, ensuring that exposures between bats and pigs are limited. In Bangladesh, however, the bats are infecting hosts via palm sap. In this area, palm sap is a large, product good and bats are getting into the collection sites and humans are consuming the infected sap. Prevention measures include monitoring the sap production and placing covers over the collection sites to reduce contact with bats.

[Avian Reovirus]{.underline}

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

-   ARV can spread through both horizontal transmission, via the fecal-oral route, and vertical transmission. Transmission is exacerbated by poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, and inadequate ventilation. along with an increase in humidity and temperature, which increases virus stability. Since the pathogen replicates in the intestines, the fecal-oral route is supported. One wild bird disease caused by ARV is viral arthritis, which can decrease movement for wild birds, leading to an overall decrease in survivability.

[Langya henipavirus]{.underline}

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

-   The main transmission of LayV is from spillover from wild shrews through both direct and indirect contact. There is a possibility that goats and dogs can transmit the virus to humans. LayV is considered a spillover due to the virus not being able to sustain within the H2 population, humans.

\@ 95% CI

Adult - 52.2% (36 infected out of 69 total)

Young Adult - 37.8% (14 infected out of 37 total)

[Real-World Analysis]{.underline}

This data shows that raccoons that are female, older, and live in the south/central region have a higher chance of contracting *B. procyonis* disease is less prevalent in raccoons that are young adults, male, or live in the northern regions. Because of this, disease prevention and control should be focused on the older populations that reside in the southern and central regions of the US.

**Worksheet 9**

1.  In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

    -   The zoonotic spread of Salmonella comes from 3 main pathways. One being that backyard poultry owners will tend to have more direct contact with the birds. The second comes from the soil around the coop, which is contaminated with feces, and owners most likely don't take precautions when it comes to shoe safety. The third exposure comes from young children who are most susceptible and least likely to practice proper hygiene. These three behaviors together greatly increase pathogen spillover to humans, who then have the possibility to spread it back to other birds, creating a cyclic event.

2.  Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

<!-- -->

a.  What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte? What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?
    -   When fescue grass is infected with a Fungal endophyte the grass tends to grow better and becomes more lush. This only creates more of a hazard, since the grass is doing so well, the grazing animals have more to eat, which drives infections.

<!-- -->

b.  What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 4 points
    -   Temperature and drought stress increase the alkaloid production, which increases the severity of infection.
c.  What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?
    -   Weight loss, rough or discolored hair, and poor performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Worksheet 10**

1.  What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 10 points

    -   ASF can spread via vector-borne ticks, direct pig-to-pig contact, indirect contact through contaminated feed, environmental spread through contaminated pork products, and human spread. Humans play a role as the handler and have a responsibility to keep proper handling and transportation conditions to reduce the spread.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. 10 points

    -   KoRV has the same effects as HIV, where the Koala's immune system is weakened, which allows higher bacterial loads and increased mortality and infertility rates.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? 10 points

    -   False negatives are common within PCR results, along with trapping the snakes other animals that may find themselves in the trap, making it harder for snakes to inhabit the traps. Snakes can also be difficult to identify which snake have already been tested and may require time time-consuming search through photos of previous snakes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Final Exam**

12/5/25

1\. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect (10 points)

a\. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

-   False. This would be deemed a Case 2 outcome, Apparent multihost pathogen

b\. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.

-   False, the disease is infectious but not contagious within the species and is only transmitted by vectors.

c\. The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

-   False, The eggs can accumulate at raccoon latrine sites and remain infective for up to 6 y after defecation.

d\. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

-   False, The infection is not directly associated with the infection, but is known as a Fescue-associated infection due to the underlying cause coming from toxic alkaloids which work together to induce illness.

e\. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus.

-   False Northern Cardinals are considered super suppressors

2\. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years, given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (10 points)

-   Changes in the community to prevent infections started with ex President Jimmy Carter and the Carter Foundation, who introduced LifeStraw, a pipe filter used to filter drinking water. there were also efforts to educate on proper water filtration techniques. These help directly reduce the amount of larvae a person may come into contact with since the infection starts in the digestive system. Targeted use of the larvicide ABATE in stagnant water sources. This reduces the amount of larvae in the water since larvae are what start the infection. This also reduces the intermediate host infections. The last intervention was the use of protected wells for water, which helps reduce contact with larvae. With dogs now becoming a source of infection, it is now important that animals like dogs are prevented from coming into contact with contaminated fish entrails to stop the continued spread of disease.

3\. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (10 points)

-   Difficulties in the management of CWD arise because there is no vaccine or treatment, tools for effectively managing he spread of CWD remain limited, infectious individuals are difficult to detect, imperfect detectability in the early phase of CWD outbreak, asymptomatic transmission, and by the time CWD is detected in a population, it is already established and difficult to eliminate.

-   Control is also difficult because these cervids can move in many different ways through free ranging, escape from captive facilities, improper transportation of breeders, use of infected bodily fluids and improper use of infected baits and feeders.

4\. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with Mycobacterium leprae. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population:

• March 2025: 3 infected

• April 2025: 5 infected

• May 2025: 5 infected

• June 2025: 8 infected

-   July - 5/52 - (0.096) 9.6 cases per 100 animals per month

-   Average monthly incidence - 13/60 -\> 0.22/5 -\> (0.04)

b\. Which month had the highest prevalence? Which month had the lowest prevalence? Show your calculations and state the units. (5 points)

-   March - 3/60 (0.05) 5% of armadillo population - Lowest

-   April - 5/60 (0.083) 8.3% of armadillo population

-   May - 5/60 (0.083) 8.3% of armadillo population

-   June - 8/60 (0.13) 13% of armadillo population

-   July - 13/60 (0.21) 21% of armadillo population - Highest

5\. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.

a\. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? (2 points)

-   Francisella tularensis, caused by Subspecies holartica

b\. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? (2 points)

-   Vector-borne, direct contact, inhalation, or ingestion

c\. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/ public health. (3 points)

-   Because this pathogen can infect the host through many different pathways, it becomes a public health risk, and the disease is known to cause different symptoms based on transmission route.

7\. Refer to the life cycle of blacklegged tick to answer 7a – 7d. (8 points)

a\. The two stages of blacklegged tick that can potentially transmit Lyme disease to humans are: **Nymph and Adult.**

b\. Preferred hosts of the larval stage of Ixodes scapularis are: **Small mammals (white footed mice) and Birds.**

c\. Lyme disease risk posed by host-seeking nymphs of I. scapularis is greatest during **May-July** (season/months) while Lyme disease risk posed by host-seeking adults is greatest during **October-December** (season/months).

d\. The natural reservoir and competent hosts of Borrelia burgdorferi in North America: White footed mouse. White-tailed deer are the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in the Lyme disease system.

-    **preferred host**

8\. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white- tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (10 points)

-   One downside is that when using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance is that you assume the population is closed and finite, sampling is random, and he disease is evenly distributed across the entire population, which does not accurately represent a wild free free-ranging population. In a typical wild free-ranging population, sampling is not always random since most hunters are not targeting sick deer; they want healthy, strong deer. Since CWD causes neurological symptoms, hunters are more likely to avoid deer that are acting strangely. Since this is a wild population, the population is ever-changing with deer migrating across state lines and herds breeding and dying. The data should not be used to say definitively that the disease does not exist, but should be used in determining the relative risk of disease within the population.

9\. Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (10 points)

a\. SARS-CoV-2

-   Case 4, possible EID, SARS-CoV-2 was very contagious between and within species

b\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome

-   Case 1 Spillover, The virus comes from rodents, which do not show symptoms, and the disease does not spread from human to human.

Langya Henipavirus

-   Case 1, spillover event. this is because the infections in humans does not spread within the species, and the reservoir species are silent carriers

d\. Brucellosis

-   Case 3, True multihost pathogen, Able to infect across and within species.

e\. West Nile virus

-   Case 1, Spillover, both cross-species infection and within H2 infections are low

10\. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (8 points)

-   Definitive host - Dolphins, this is where the parasite reaches sexual maturity

-   Dead-end host - Humans, the parasite does not mature or reproduce or mature

-   Paratenic host - Fish, they transport the parasite, but are not necessary for reproduction

-   Intermediate host - Crustaceans, the parasites develop within these species

11\. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (3 points)

-   This is not a true statement; in many cases, such as the case with hantavirus, the reservoir species, rodents, do not show clinical symptoms but are still infected and can transmit the disease. Another case is Lyme disease, where Ticks are infected but show no symptoms and can pass on to humans and other animals. In human cases, humans can be infected but be considered asymptomatic. In cases of COVID-19, many people become infected but not diseased and could still spread the disease without knowing.

12\. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (3 points)

-   1-1/2.5=0.60 so 60% need to be vaccinated.

13\. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. (6 points)

-   Some of the main challenges when managing wildlife diseases come from how complex disease systems can be. When looking at the epi triad of disease we see that many diseases have multiple host factors such as Lyme, which can infect both wild animals and humans in many different ways. Some diseases, like Pasteurella multocida in the saiga antelope, increase virulence when temperatures change, and it is impossible to control the weather, so other management strategies have to be implemented, which can become complex. Many times, monitoring disease becomes tricky because many free-ranging animals like deer cannot be tracked very easily, and vaccination of these animals becomes very tricky and, in many cases, inefficient or cost-ineffective. Some diseases, like CWD, have no vaccine and can be unknowingly spread through the transportation of deer and deer products, in which the transporters have no idea they carry infected deer.
