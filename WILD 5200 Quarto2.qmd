[**Tick Lab**]{.underline}

When identifying tick species, you first begin with the life stage. This is evident by the presence or absence of a genital pore and the number of legs, with larvae having 6 and adults and nymphs having 8. The next step is to identify sex with males having conscutum and females having alloscutum. The third step is to identify the genus based on the location of the anal groove, anterior or posterior. The last step in tick identification is to identify species using the SAM method: Scutum pattern, Anal groove location, and whether the mouthparts are long or short. It is important to be able to identify ticks because of the pathogens each one carries. Each tick species carries diseases that can become a threat to public health if not properly monitored.

**Exam 1 Rework**

7.  Mass die-off of saiga antelopes was caused by a bacterium called *Pasteurella multocida*, which typically lives in the nasal cavities of the antelopes; however, in 2015, the environmental conditions led to increased humidity and temperatures, which caused the bacteria to become pathogenic and deadly to the antelopes. Because the antelopes gather in large populations during the birthing season, the close contact greatly increased the host availability, allowing the pathogen to run rampant within the population, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals. Some strategies to prevent these MMEs in the future include monitoring environmental conditions, researching potential vaccines, and improving disease surveillance. Broader conservation methods include reducing other stressors on the population, such as poaching and habitat loss, so that saiga numbers can recover naturally.

9.  R₀ is the basic reproduction number noted by the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population.

    Situation 1 - one flamingo infects 1 flamingo for a total of 1

    Situation 2 - one flamingo infects 3 flamingos for a total of 3

    Situation 3 - one flamingo infects 2 flamingos for a total of 2

    Situation 4 - One infected flamingo infects 0 other flamingos for a total of 0

The average of the R₀ in the 4 situations is 1+3+2+0/4 = 1.5

In the real world, utility R₀ can be used to describe how infectious a particular disease is, with R₀\> 1 indicating the infection will likely spread through the population and could become a pandemic, R₀=1 representing that the disease is in a steady state and remains endemic, and R₀\<1 representing that the infection will die out. R₀ can also be used in disease models and can be calculated by the rate of infection/ the rate of recovery, or β​/γ.

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in healthcare–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Center for Disease Prevention and Control)

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

-   The disease is maintained within the Camel population

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

-   True Camels are the main animal reservoir

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

-   True Humans are the dead-end host

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

-   No, as stated above, the case fatality rate is 35%

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

-   The epi curve represents a propagated outbreak due to the many peaks noted on the graph

**Worksheet 5**

Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024 The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1\. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

-   This incident would be considered a spillover event based on the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen. This is because humans contracted the virus from a reservoir animal species to humans and it consisted of non-sustained human-to-human transmission.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings? 5 points

-   One way to reduce transmission within the community is to educate the public on the situation and how to avoid bat exposure, mentioning staying away from caves inhabited by bats without proper PPE. Those who experience symptoms should self-isolate to limit the spread and report their symptoms to the local health authorities for outbreak surveillance. Fention and Penfersen recommend 3 techniques in controlling infection

    -   Control the target population (Humans)

    -   prevent transmission between the target and reservoir

    -   Control the Reservoir (Bats)

-   To reduce the spread of infection in hospital settings, those working directly with patients should have proper PPE and practice correct hand washing techniques. Patients with similar symptoms should be grouped together to avoid contact with uninfected patients. Patients' rooms who were infectious should receive proper cleaning with disinfectants.

**Worksheet 6**

Pond 1

• Prevalence

N- 20, Infected - 6

Prevalence (30%) Lower - 14%, upper - 52.5% at 95% CI

• Fisher’s exact test p-value - 0.1987

Pond 2

• Prevalence (6.7%) Lower - 0.3%, upper - 30.2% at 95% CI

N- 15, Infected -1

• Fisher’s exact test p-value - 0.1987

• Interpretation

Prevalence was found to be higher in pond 1 than in pond 2, but it cannot be determined to be statistically significant due to the Fisher’s exact test p-value being greater than 0.05, and it is assumed that the observed difference in prevalence is most likely due to random chance.

**Worksheet 7**

[Nipah Virus]{.underline}

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

-   In Malaysia, Bats are infecting food that pigs are consuming; in this case, pigs are the bridge host that are able to pass on the disease to humans. This focuses the preventive measures towards the bridge species, ensuring that exposures between bats and pigs are limited. In Bangladesh, however, the bats are infecting hosts via palm sap. In this area, palm sap is a large, product good and bats are getting into the collection sites and humans are consuming the infected sap. Prevention measures include monitoring the sap production and placing covers over the collection sites to reduce contact with bats.

[Avian Reovirus]{.underline}

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

-   ARV can spread through both horizontal transmission, via the fecal-oral route, and vertical transmission. Transmission is exacerbated by poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, and inadequate ventilation. along with an increase in humidity and temperature, which increases virus stability. Since the pathogen replicates in the intestines, the fecal-oral route is supported. One wild bird disease caused by ARV is viral arthritis, which can decrease movement for wild birds, leading to an overall decrease in survivability.

[Langya henipavirus]{.underline}

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

-   The main transmission of LayV is from spillover from wild shrews through both direct and indirect contact. There is a possibility that goats and dogs can transmit the virus to humans. LayV is considered a spillover due to the virus not being able to sustain within the H2 population, humans.
